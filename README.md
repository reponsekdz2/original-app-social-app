## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup & Installation

To run this project locally, you will need Node.js, npm, and a MySQL server installed.

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up the database
#  - Start your local MySQL server.
#  - Create a new database (e.g., CREATE DATABASE talka;).
#  - Execute the SQL commands in `schema.txt` to create all tables.

# 4. Create upload directories
#  - Inside the `backend/` directory, create an `uploads` folder.
#  - Inside `uploads`, create the following subfolders: `assets`, `attachments`, `carousel`, `stickers`.
#  - Place your audio files inside `backend/uploads/assets/`:
#    - ringtone.mp3 (for calls)
#    - notification.mp3 (for toast notifications)
#    - message.mp3 (for new messages)

# 5. Configure environment variables
#  - Create a file named `.env` in the `backend/` directory.
#  - Copy the contents of the "Environment Variables" section below into it and fill in your details.
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

The frontend is built with Vite. The provided files are ready to be used in a Vite project.

```bash
# 1. In the project's root directory (where index.html is), install dependencies
# Note: The importmap in index.html is for AI Studio compatibility.
# For local dev, a package.json is recommended. You can create one with `npm init -y`.
npm install react react-dom socket.io-client

# 2. Install Vite and the React plugin as development dependencies
npm install --save-dev vite @vitejs/plugin-react typescript

# 3. Create a `vite.config.ts` file in the root directory and add the provided configuration.
# This sets up the proxy to the backend for seamless development.
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application Locally

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # From the `backend/` directory
    npm start
    ```
    The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:3001`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # From your frontend project root directory
    npx vite
    ```
    The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite). The `vite.config.ts` will automatically proxy API requests to your backend.

## üöÄ Deployment

Deploying a full-stack application involves two main parts: building the frontend for production and running the backend server in a stable environment.

### Step 1: Build the Frontend

First, build the static frontend files. This process bundles your React code, minifies it, and prepares it for production.

```bash
# From the frontend project root directory
npx vite build
```

This command will create a `dist` directory in your project root. This directory contains the optimized `index.html`, JavaScript, and CSS files that will be served to your users.

### Step 2: Deploy the Backend

The backend server needs to run continuously. You can deploy it to any cloud provider (like Google Cloud, AWS, Vercel, etc.) or your own server. Using the provided `Dockerfile` is a highly recommended approach for a portable and scalable deployment.

```bash
# From the backend/ directory
# 1. Build the Docker image
docker build -t talka-backend .

# 2. Run the Docker container
# Replace the .env file values with your production secrets
docker run -p 3001:3001 --env-file .env talka-backend
```

### Step 3: Set Up a Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx)

In production, you should **not** serve your frontend and backend from different ports directly to the public. A reverse proxy is the standard solution. It sits in front of your application and routes requests to the appropriate service.

**Example Nginx Configuration:**

This configuration serves the static frontend files from the `dist` directory and forwards any request starting with `/api` or `/uploads` to the backend Node.js server.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    # Root location for the built frontend files
    location / {
        root   /path/to/your/frontend/dist;
        index  index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; # Important for single-page apps
    }

    # Proxy API requests to the backend server
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    # Proxy file uploads to the backend server
    location /uploads {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
    
    # Proxy Socket.IO connections
    location /socket.io/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    }
}
```

## ü§´ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with the following content:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=talka

# Session Secret for Authentication
SESSION_SECRET=your_super_secret_string_that_is_long_and_random

# Gemini API Key (Securely stored on the backend)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

# Server Port
PORT=3001
```
