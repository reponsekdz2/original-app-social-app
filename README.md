## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

To run this project locally, you will need Node.js, npm, and a MySQL server installed.

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up the database
#  - Start your local MySQL server.
#  - Create a new database (e.g., CREATE DATABASE talka;).
#  - Execute the SQL commands in `schema.txt` to create all tables.

# 4. Create upload directories
#  - Inside the `backend/` directory, create an `uploads` folder.
#  - Inside `uploads`, create the following subfolders: `assets`, `attachments`, `carousel`, `stickers`.
#  - Place your audio files inside `backend/uploads/assets/`:
#    - ringtone.mp3 (for calls)
#    - notification.mp3 (for toast notifications)
#    - message.mp3 (for new messages)

# 5. Configure environment variables
#  - Create a file named `.env` in the `backend/` directory.
#  - Copy the contents of the "Environment Variables" section below into it and fill in your details.
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

The frontend is built to run with a modern development server like Vite.

```bash
# 1. Install Vite (if you don't have it)
npm create vite@latest my-talka-frontend -- --template react-ts

# 2. Replace the contents of the `src` and `public` folders in your new Vite project
#    with the frontend files from this repository (e.g., App.tsx, index.tsx, components/, etc.).

# 3. Copy `index.html` to the root of your Vite project.

# 4. Install dependencies (React will be included by Vite, add socket.io-client)
npm install socket.io-client

# 5. Run the frontend development server
npm run dev
```
